<b>HTML Markups</b>
<p>HTML markups are made up of <b>tags</b>. They start with a opening tag and end with a closing tag. Inbetween the opening and closing tags is the content, this is also a tag.  These tags all together as a whole are
called an <b>element</b>.</p>
<b>Some Example of Tags</b>
<p><li><b>b</b> = Bold</li>
<li><b>em</b> = Italic</li>
<li><b>p</b> = Paragraph</li>
<li><b>br</b> = Line break</li>
<li><b>img</b> = Images</li></p>
<b>Elements (Inline and Block)</b>
<p>There are two types of elements <b>inline</b> and <b>block</b>. Inline only occupies the space along the content. Block forms a box or block that works like a container around the content.</p>
